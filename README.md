# MA_GTFS
As many GTFS files for the state of Massachusetts as I could find.
## How to Access Files:
Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ma-otp/gtfs and download any GTFS files you want.
## File Sources:
Most of the files here are from https://www.mass.gov/lists/mbta-and-transit-data-for-developers.  
MBTA data is from https://www.mbta.com/developers/gtfs.
Boston Express data was found at https://busmaps.com/en/usa/Transport-Usa/boston-express, as the one on MassDOT's page has a lot of errors with its formatting and data.
## Am I Missing Any Agencies?
Feel free to leave a request for new agencies as an "issue" on this page.  
Currently 128 Buisiness Council and Crosstown Connect are being worked on. I also plan to add Lexpress buses and EZ-ride. 
  
This project is part of my Docker_OpenTripPlanner project. If you are interested, more information about that project can be found on its repository at https://github.com/Thomthecoder17/Docker_OpenTripPlanner.
