# MA_GTFS
As many GTFS files for the state of Massachusetts as I could find.
## How to Access Files:
Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/ma-gtfs and download any GTFS files you want.
## File Sources:
Most of the files here are from https://www.mass.gov/lists/mbta-and-transit-data-for-developers.  
MBTA data is from https://www.mbta.com/developers/gtfs.
## Am I Missing Any Agencies?
Feel free to leave a request for new agencies as an "issue" on this page.
